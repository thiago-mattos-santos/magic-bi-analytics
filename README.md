## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built to analyze Magic: The Gathering Commander games.

It simulates a real-world analytics workflow, covering the full pipeline:
- Data extraction from external sources
- Data transformation and validation
- Data modeling in a relational database
- Interactive dashboard creation

The goal is to demonstrate strong fundamentals in data engineering, data modeling, and business intelligence.

## Architecture

Google Sheets → Python ETL → PostgreSQL → Power BI

## Tech Stack

- **Python** — Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
- **PostgreSQL** — Data storage and modeling (star schema)
- **Power BI** — Data visualization and dashboarding
- **Google Sheets** — Data source

## Data Model

The project follows a **star schema design**.

### Fact Table
- `FACT_GAMES` → 1 row per player per game

### Dimension Tables
- `DIM_PLAYER`
- `DIM_COMMANDER`
- `DIM_COLOR`
- `DIM_SEASON`
- `DIM_SCORE_RULE`

## ETL Process

### Extract
- Data is extracted from Google Sheets using Python

### Transform
- Data cleaning and validation
- Type conversion (dates, booleans, durations)
- Business rules applied
- Error handling and logging

### Load
- Full refresh strategy:
  - `TRUNCATE` + `INSERT`
- Data loaded into PostgreSQL

## Key Features

- Dynamic performance metrics:
  - Matches
  - Victories (3-player and 4-player)
  - Win rate
  - Score calculation
  - Combos tracking

- Data validation:
  - Invalid rows detection and logging
  - Format validation (duration, color, etc.)

- Modular architecture:
  - `extract`, `transform`, `load` separation
  - Reusable components

## SQL Layer

In addition to the Python ETL pipeline, this project includes SQL scripts responsible for analytical logic inside PostgreSQL.

This layer is used to:
- reproduce ranking rules directly in the database
- apply business logic for leaderboard eligibility
- generate final analytical tables consumed by Power BI

Example:
- `sql/ranking_points.sql` → creates the `ranking_points` table with bonus score logic by player and season

## Dashboard

### Navigation Page

Dashboard Navigation

This page was designed as the entry point of the dashboard, combining page navigation with high-level highlights from the dataset.

It includes:

- direct navigation buttons to the main analytical pages
- a Hall of Fame section with record-based highlights for players and commanders
- an Insights section with short analytical statements summarizing key patterns from the dataset

The goal of this page is to provide a cleaner and more guided dashboard experience, helping users navigate the report while also surfacing quick-read conclusions about performance, score dynamics, starting position behavior, combo frequency, and deck composition.

### Season Overview

### All Seasons Overview
![All Seasons Overview](assets/screenshots/season_overview_all.png)

These pages were designed to provide a high-level analytical view of match activity, player performance, and score distribution across the dataset. It combines core KPIs, score-based rankings, efficiency indicators, and trend analysis to support both broad monitoring and deeper performance interpretation.

A central part of this view is the relationship between **volume and efficiency**. The page allows performance to be interpreted not only through total matches and accumulated score, but also through win rate, starting position results, and the impact of different game sizes. It also includes a scoring perspective that helps distinguish players who lead through consistency and participation from those who stand out through stronger efficiency.

The project includes two complementary versions of this page:
- **Single Season Overview** — focused on one selected season at a time
- **All Seasons Overview** — focused on the full historical view

This split was intentionally adopted to preserve analytical consistency, since some calculations and ranking behaviors differ between season-specific and all-time contexts.

### Player Overview
![Player Overview](assets/screenshots/player_overview_all.png)

This page was designed as a player-centered analytical view, combining overall player benchmarks with a detailed breakdown of an individually selected player.

It includes:

- general player benchmarks and top-3 comparisons
- selected player KPIs and summary metrics
- games and victories over time
- commander-level performance breakdown
- recent match history
- contextual highlights such as streaks, ranks, opponents defeated, and game speed patterns
- score composition and starting position analysis

Several KPI cards and visuals also include contextual tooltips, adding complementary detail without overcrowding the main layout.

The goal of this page is to move beyond simple aggregate metrics and provide a more complete understanding of how a specific player performs, which commanders drive their results, how their score is built, how their recent trajectory compares with their broader historical profile, and under which conditions they tend to perform better.

### Commander Overview
![Commander Overview](assets/screenshots/commander_overview_all.png)

This page was designed as a commander-centered analytical view, combining overall context with a detailed breakdown of an individually selected commander.

It includes:
- general commander benchmarks and top-3 comparisons
- selected commander KPIs and summary metrics
- performance over time
- recent match history
- contextual highlights such as streaks, ranks, opponents defeated, and usage patterns
- breakdowns by starting position and number of players

The goal of this page is to move beyond simple aggregate metrics and provide a more tactical understanding of how a specific commander performs, how often it is used, under which conditions it performs better, and how its recent trajectory compares with its broader historical profile.



## Additional Analytics (Python Layer)

A future layer of the project will focus on reproducing key analytical views in Python, extending the same logic used in Power BI to a programmatic environment.

The goal is to:
- replicate dashboard metrics in Python
- validate calculations across BI, SQL, and Python layers
- support exploratory and advanced analysis beyond the dashboard

Planned use cases include player vs opponent analysis and Python-based replication of existing report views.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/thiago-mattos-santos/magic-bi-analytics.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    cd magic-bi-analytics

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

4. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the pipeline:

    python src/main.py

## Future Improvements

- SQL validation layer for metric verification
- Dashboard enhancements and storytelling improvements
- PySpark implementation for scalability
- Cloud pipeline simulation (scheduled execution)
- Data quality monitoring
- Python-based dashboard and metrics replication

## Project Status

This project is actively maintained and continuously improved to simulate real-world data workflows.
